# Snippets Catalog

This directory collects stand-alone code fragments ready for copy-and-paste reuse.

- Group snippets by language (for example, `python/`, `typescript/`).
- Keep each file focused on a single pattern and include a one-line description at the top.
- Prefer standard-library solutions; call out external dependencies in inline comments.
